## Local Installation
Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org), then run the following command in the console: 
```javascript
npm install
```

## Getting Started
Locally build, start http server, open browser:
```javascript
npm start
```

## Development
### Add or Update Data
Copy the data as tab-separated csv file named _id_.csv into the folder 'data'. Refresh browser.  

### Add or Update Metadata
- Copy the js file named _id_.js into the folder 'metadata/single'.
- On test system (https://github.com/statabs-test/indikatoren), the master branch is automatically built and deployed to [github pages](https://statabs-test.github.io/indikatoren/) via [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/statabs-test/indikatoren) - thus no local build necessary. 
- For a local build: Rebuild the project to regenerate the json databases for indikatorensets (in folder 'metadata/sets') and for all indikatoren (file metadata/portal/indikatoren.js): 
```javascript
npm run build
``` 

### Add or Update Chart Configurations
- Copy the chart configuration file named _id_.js into the folder 'charts/templates'.
- On test system (https://github.com/statabs-test/indikatoren), the master branch is automatically built and deployed to [github pages](https://statabs-test.github.io/indikatoren/) via [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/statabs-test/indikatoren) - thus no local build necessary. 
- For a local build: Rebuild the project to regenerate metadata databases, final chart configurations, and svg thumbnail images for all indicators: 
```javascript
npm run build
``` 

### Build Application Locally  
Build:
```javascript
npm run build
```

Manually create svg thumbnails: 
- For the portal view: In Chrome, open thumbnails.html.
- For the indikatorenset view: In Chrome, open thumbnails.html?indikatorensetView=true.
This will download all svg files to the local downloads directory. You can then manually move them to their respective directory below /images/.


### Updating dependencies
To update all packages, run the following command, then do intensive testing of the application: 
```javascript
npm run build:update_dependencies
```

If testing succeededs, shrinkwrap and [shrinkpack](https://github.com/JamieMason/shrinkpack) the dependencies with their exact versions in order to build a reproducole installation package, using the following command: 
```javascript
npm run build:shrinkpack
```
